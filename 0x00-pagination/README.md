Introduction

This Python library/module (replace with actual name) simplifies the process of implementing pagination for your web applications or APIs. It provides a flexible and efficient way to divide large datasets into manageable pages, allowing users to navigate through the data easily.

Features

Integration with popular frameworks: Designed to work seamlessly with common Python web frameworks like Flask, Django, etc. (Provide specific examples if applicable)
Flexible configuration: Customize the number of items per page, page size, and other pagination parameters to suit your needs.
Clear and concise API: Offers a well-documented API with easy-to-use functions for creating paginated lists.
Efficiency: Optimized for performance to handle large datasets efficiently. (Consider mentioning specific optimizations if relevant)
Installation

To install the library:

Bash
pip install your_library_name
Use code with caution.

Usage

Import the module:

Python
from your_library import paginate
Use code with caution.

Prepare your data:

Python
# Example: Large list of items (replace with your actual data source)
items = [item1, item2, ..., itemN]
Use code with caution.

Paginate the data:

Python
# Basic pagination with defaults (adjust parameters as needed)
per_page = 10  # Number of items per page
page = request.args.get('page', 1)  # Get current page from request (if applicable)

paginated_items, total_pages = paginate(items, per_page=per_page, page=page)
Use code with caution.

Access paginated data and metadata:

Python
# Access the current page's items
current_page_items = paginated_items

# Access total number of pages
total_pages = total_pages
Use code with caution.

Display pagination links (optional):

HTML
{% for page_number in range(1, total_pages + 1) %}
    <a href="?page={{ page_number }}">Page {{ page_number }}</a>
{% endfor %}
Use code with caution.

Customization (Optional)

Override default values for per_page and other parameters.
Implement custom logic for page calculations or data filtering within the pagination functions (if applicable to your module).
Integrate with your framework's templating engine to display pagination links dynamically.

Additional Considerations

Consider addressing potential edge cases, such as handling situations where the requested page is out of bounds or the total number of items is zero.
If the library offers support for specific web frameworks, provide more detailed instructions and code examples tailored to those frameworks.
Include clear and well-organized documentation within the code using docstrings or comments.
